Appendix C: An alternative method leading to the derivation of Niggli matrices ​
Niggli derived his 41 standard general reduced cells by applying Eisenstein's (1851) 
theory of reduced ternary quadratic forms to the equation for determining the absolute 
length of any vector, L, in any lattice. ​ This equation is:
L² = U²a² + V²b² + W²c² + 2UVab cosγ + 2UWac cosβ + 2VWbc cosα
where a, b, c, α, β, and γ are the cell constants, and U, V, W are integers. The above 
equation may be identified with the following equation of Eisenstein:
f² = x²a + y²b + z²c + 2xyt + 2xzv + 2yzr
Subject to a series of remarkable conditions, Eisenstein's equations may be reduced, i.e., 
a unique solution may be found. ​ If two or more Eisenstein equations are to be classed 
as equivalent, one merely needs to compare their reduced forms. ​ If the reduced forms 
are equivalent, the original equations are equivalent. ​
The Eisenstein conditions applicable to the crystallographic equation given above are:

The cosines of the interaxial angles must all be positive or all negative. ​
The squared lengths of the cell edges must satisfy the inequality: a² ≤ b² ≤ c².
The scalar products of the cell edges must satisfy the inequality: |ab cosγ| ≤ a², |ac cosβ| ≤ a², |bc cosα| ≤ b².
The scalar products of the cell edges must satisfy the inequality: |ab cosγ| + |ac cosβ| + |bc cosα| ≤ a² + b² + c².
The scalar products of the cell edges must satisfy the inequality: |ab cosγ| + |ac cosβ| + |bc cosα| ≤ a² + b² + c²,
and the sum of the scalar products must be zero.
The cell must be primitive, meaning it cannot be reduced further. ​

According to the definition of a lattice, any lattice point may be reached from any other 
lattice point by appropriate translation of the vectors (or fractions of the vectors) 
chosen to describe the edges of the unit cell. ​ It follows then, that the vector distance 
from an origin to any given lattice point may be found from any of the infinite number 
of unit cells that may be defined. ​
The Eisenstein conditions given above imply that any lattice and any vector distance 
may be examined by the following procedure:

In a given lattice, let a unit cell be chosen. ​
Let the cell be subjected to the Eisenstein conditions. ​
If the cell passes all the criteria implied by the conditions, it is said to be 
Eisenstein reduced and may represent a unique solution. ​
If the cell chosen does not pass the conditions, it is not Eisenstein reduced, 
and the implication is that another cell must be chosen if a unique solution is desired. ​

The application of Eisenstein conditions to several types of cells is illustrated below:
Example 1: For a simple cubic cell (Fig. ​ 44A, Appendix A), let the cell chosen be:
a = b = c, for which cosα = cosβ = cosγ = 0.
The cell passes all Eisenstein conditions and is Eisenstein reduced. ​
Example 2a: For a body-centered cubic cell (Fig. 44B, Appendix A), let the cell chosen be:
a = 1/2√3, b = a, c = √3, with cosα = cosβ = cosγ = 1/3.
The cell does not pass all Eisenstein conditions and is not Eisenstein reduced. ​
Example 2b: For a body-centered cubic cell (Fig. ​ 44B, Appendix A), let the cell chosen be:
a = 1/2√3, b = a, c = √3, with cosα = cosβ = cosγ = -1/3.
The cell passes all Eisenstein conditions and is Eisenstein reduced. ​
Example 3a: For a face-centered cubic cell (Fig. ​ 44C, Appendix A), let the cell chosen be:
a = 1/2√2, b = a, c = √2, with cosα = cosβ = cosγ = 1/2.
The cell passes all Eisenstein conditions and is Eisenstein reduced. ​
Example 3b: For a face-centered cubic cell (Fig. ​ 44C, Appendix A), let the cell chosen be:
a = 1/2√2, b = a, c = √2, with cosα = cosβ = cosγ = -1/2.
The cell does not pass all Eisenstein conditions and is not Eisenstein reduced. ​
Jones (1935) writes that for any given point lattice, an Eisenstein reduction 
"amounts to picking a coordinate system (i.e., a unit cell) as follows: choose 
any point O of the lattice as the origin, call A one of the points of the lattice 
closest to O, draw the X axis along OA, choose as B one of the points as close 
to O (X, i.e., the X axis) as any point of the lattice not on the X axis and draw 
he Y axis along OB, choose as C one of the points as close to O as any point of 
the lattice not in the XY plane and draw the Z axis along OC." ​
A systematic application of this recipe to the point lattices having various 
generalized dimensional configurations will yield the 41 Niggli reduced cells. ​ 
The addition of the expression "(X, i.e., the X axis)" to the above definition 
is important, as it was shown in Example 3b that a lattice point may be chosen 
"as close to O as any point of the lattice not on the X axis," which does not 
yield an Eisenstein reduction. ​ On the other hand, in Example 3a, an Eisenstein 
reduction is obtained if the lattice point chosen is the one closest to 
the OX line, i.e., the X axis. ​
The cell chosen in Example 3b, while it is composed of a set of three shortest 
noncoplanar vectors having the cosines of the interaxial angles all negative 
and may therefore be classed as reduced, is not Eisenstein reduced. ​ It is a
ctually a very special case that would occur in the body-centered tetragonal 
lattice (Fig. ​ 5C, Appendix A) when the ratio c/a = √2. ​ In this case, the 
Eisenstein reduced form is the reduced cell given in Example 3a for the 
face-centered cubic lattice. ​
The 41 Niggli matrices are all Eisenstein reduced. ​ It does not necessarily 
follow that special or degenerate representations of these matrices will 
yield cells that are themselves Eisenstein reduced. ​ A hexagonal lattice 
having c/a = 1.0 generates a special Niggli representation, and the 
reduced cell (in standard orientation) is also Eisenstein reduced. ​ However, 
a body-centered tetragonal lattice with c/a = √2 also generates a special 
Niggli representation, but the reduced cell (in standard orientation) 
is not Eisenstein reduced. ​
