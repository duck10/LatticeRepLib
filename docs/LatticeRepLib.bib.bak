  Abstract                 = {The principal achievement of Bravais - the separation of lattices into 14
types and the derivation of the so-called Bravais parallelepipeds for these
types [32] -- had an immense significance for the whole of geometric crystallography.
This work can be put into line with such notable achievements as the
derivation of the 32 crystal classes, 47 simple forms, and 230 spatial groups.
At the present time 4-dimensional and n-dimensional crystallography are
being strongly developed, which are now difficult to construct on the basis of
the elementary-geometric considerations used in 3-dimensional crystallography.
The basis method in n-dimensional crystallography today is the so-called arithmetic
method, i.e., the application of finite groups of integral matrices. The
most important application of this method was, in its time (1948),that by Zassenhaus
[54] who showed that if all the nonequivalent n-dimensional groups of integral
matrices are known for any n, then all the n-dimensional Fedorov groups are
now obtained automatically. But at the present time (1971), the German scientists
Wondratschek, Neub~ser, and B~low have obtained by this method the farfrom-
easy-to-get solution to the problem of 4-dimensional Bravais types of lattices
[34, 47, 53].
In the present paper we dwell in detail only on those aspects of the arithmetic
method which are directly connected with Bravais' papers. At the end we
give two further directions in the development of the arithmetic method, one of
which is connected with the use of the so-called perfect polytope of Voronoi [6],
while the other, particularly important as far as we are concerned, is connected
with the analysis of the absolute region of reduction.
In conclusion the authors can report with satisfaction on the recent great
achievement of Ryshkov who, using the methods described, found once again all
the 4-dimensional Bravais types as well as the Bravais types of 5-dimensional
lattices.},
