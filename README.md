# LatticeRepLib
Lattice Representation Library with test codes and programs for investigating spaces for 3-D lattices


Identification of lattices has several important uses. Bravais lattice identification and the constructing of unit cell databases have been the most important and often cited uses. Lately, serial crystallography has necessitated merging of many (sometimes hundreds of thousands) individual partial images of crystal lattices. All of these benefit from methods to measure how much two lattices differ.

Lattice Representation Library (LRL) is a package of C++ classes and functions for representing and manipulating lattices and crystallographic unit cells. Included are methods for easily displaying the representations and converting between them. Many other tools are also included, such as simple output functions and Niggli and Delone reduction.
